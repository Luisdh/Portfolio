        <p>
          I have always had a passion for anything having to do with computers.
          Starting out as a hobby, I would explore the internet so I could find
          entertainment. Computers and internet has given us access to the rest
          of the world and the ideas they have to offer. Computers expanded my
          world forever and I want to help expand it for others.

          In my journey through the tech world I unraveled the mysteries that is
          a program, the intricacies that go into one and just how exactly the
          computer is able to work exactly like a canvas. Programming for me,
          has been like receiving a hammer and nail. All I have to do is grab a
          block and place it in anyway I see fit. The joy of getting a small
          line of code to work the way I had hoped is a feeling I could not put
          into words. Knowing more about the world with computers has been a
          fullfilling ride and I can't wait to see how far I will be able to
          discover.
