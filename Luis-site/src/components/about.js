        <p>
          I am experienced in web development consisting of front-end work and
          back-end but do not plan on leaving it there. I am a passionate
          Software Engineer that loves all things tech and getting into
          programming after learning the many incredible things you can create
          and accomplish. I strive to be a well rounded developer because I
          don't want to be restricted to a small area of knowledge and ability.
